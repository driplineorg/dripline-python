# Compose file that can be used for a development workflow, integrated with the rest of the integration environment
# The dripline-python source path is mounted into the container, assuming that this is being run from [dl-py top]/tests/integration
# Once the container is started, run `pip install -e /usr/local/src_dev`
# Then you should be able to run dripline applications and edit library source files on the host.
