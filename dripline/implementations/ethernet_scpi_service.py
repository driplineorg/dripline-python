    '''
    A fairly generic subclass of Service for connecting to ethernet-capable instruments/devices.
    In is developed for and tested against devices with a SCPI-compliant command set, but may be usable with devices which do not strictly conform.
    In particular, devices must support sending a response to every command received (either natively, or via SCPI's command composition) and responses are expected to include a termination marking complete transmission.

            socket_timeout (int): number of seconds to wait for a reply from the device before timeout.
            socket_info (tuple or string): either socket.socket.connect argument tuple, or string that
                parses into one.
            cmd_at_reconnect ([str,...]): a list of commands to send to the device every time the socket
                connection is estabilished note that these will be sent on *every* connection, which may be
                disruptive to ongoing activity.
            reconnect_test (str): expected return from the last command in the cmd_at_reconnect list, must
                match exactly or the reconnect is deemed a failure
            command_terminator (str): string to be post-pended to commands, indicating to the device that
                the transmission is complete (often \\r, \\n, or \\r\\n - where escaping depends on string types)
            response_terminator (str): string added to the end of a reply from the device, indicates the
                end of the reply
            reply_echo_cmd (bool): indicates that the device includes the the received command in its reply
